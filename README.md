#Automated-Excel-with-VBA
Excel File with auto copy and export data
Project made for my coworker. That's my first fully made VBA project.

Priority was to: 
- downloading data from the file
- checking the new item number
- checking a new category item and making a drop-down list
- coping data after verification and save it in the new file

Additionally added message boxes.
